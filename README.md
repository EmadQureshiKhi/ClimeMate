## üîê Blockchain Architecture and On-chain Proof

### CO‚ÇÇe Token & Escrow System

**CO‚ÇÇe Token (ClimeMate Offset Token)**
- **Token Mint:** [C9vBPNUk9ENVo5iEPY6LwBVoyNTGxZ7jU4uuqjGQde7D](https://solscan.io/token/C9vBPNUk9ENVo5iEPY6LwBVoyNTGxZ7jU4uuqjGQde7D?cluster=devnet)
- **Supply:** 1,000,000 CO‚ÇÇe (2 decimals)
- **Mint Authority:** 2-of-3 Multi-sig wallet
- **Status:** Active on Solana Devnet

**Escrow Program**
- **Program ID:** [FsqvhRRiENRHLncK3GKMitZT1V126pXGpT2dtVEHhMkf](https://solscan.io/account/FsqvhRRiENRHLncK3GKMitZT1V126pXGpT2dtVEHhMkf?cluster=devnet)
- **Type:** Atomic swap escrow (Anchor framework)
- **Price:** 0.00005 SOL per CO‚ÇÇe token
- **Holdings:** 499,999 CO‚ÇÇe available for purchase
- **Revenue:** Flows to multi-sig treasury

**Multi-sig Treasury (2-of-3)**
- **Address:** [9N1PSX7VLnBtmAdUj4JNVdWQjZrvi8vHftJPLuRNjLWM](https://solscan.io/account/9N1PSX7VLnBtmAdUj4JNVdWQjZrvi8vHftJPLuRNjLWM?cluster=devnet)
- **Type:** Native Solana multi-signature
- **Threshold:** 2 out of 3 signatures required
- **Reserves:** 500,000 CO‚ÇÇe tokens
- **Purpose:** Secure treasury management and mint authority

### Retirement & Audit Logging

**Token Retirement Process:**
1. User purchases CO‚ÇÇe tokens from escrow
2. Tokens transferred to user's wallet
3. User initiates retirement against certificate
4. Tokens burned permanently (supply decreases)
5. Memo transaction logs retirement details on-chain
6. Updated NFT minted showing new offset percentage

**Blockchain Audit Trail:**
- Every retirement creates a Solana memo transaction
- Memo contains: certificate ID, amount retired, timestamp, user wallet
- Logs are immutable and publicly verifiable
- Verify page parses memo logs from transaction history
- Full transparency for carbon credit accounting

**Remint Process:**
- After retirement, certificate NFT is updated
- New compressed NFT minted with current offset data
- Previous NFT remains as historical record
- Memo transaction logs the remint operation
- Creates complete audit chain from issuance to retirement

- **Atomic Operations:** Escrow swaps execute instantly or fail completely (no partial states)
- **Memo Logging:** Immutable on-chain records for every retirement and remint operation
- **Multi-sig Treasury:** 2-of-3 signature requirement for token supply management
